#### Feedback: 

Thank you so much for all your hard work in attempting Project 2, Yolie! Unfortunately, your project didn't reach MVP or meet the technical requirements. Sooner or later, this is bound to happen, either here or in your next career as a software engineer. The good news is that the classroom is the best place to experience this! ðŸ˜… One of the number one reasons why we don't reach MVP is because we simply run out of time. There are other reasons why it happens too, which is why it's important to make a list of takeaways. I would like for you to re-attempt this project taking into account what you learned from the first attempt. Some other things to take note of are making sure you commit and push your code frequently and also letting myself or Sal know when/if you get stuck on a problem and can't move forward. The frequent commits and pushes to Github are extremely crucial. I wasn't able to administer meaningful feedback because I only had access to an earlier version of your code. Also, be sure to include the necessary dialogue/sections in the project's README.md file to properly describe your project; this will come in handy, especially when it comes time to applying for jobs and showcasing your work.

Here are the minimum points you should add:

- Description of application 
- Link to deployed app        
- Unsolved problems           
- Link to Trello             

In the meantime, I will be scheduling a 1:1 with you on 06/3 to discuss this and plan a day for your to re-submit this project.
